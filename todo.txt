Private Messages

Users will be able to send private messages to each other, so you will need to create a chat, where it will exist :

    A section to show who is online/offline and able to talk to:
        This section must be organized by the last message sent (just like discord). If the user is new and does not present messages
        you must organize it in alphabetic order.


Posts and Comments

This part is pretty similar to the first forum. Users must be able to:

    Create comments on the posts:
        See posts in a feed display
        See comments only if they click on a post
